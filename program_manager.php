        <h1>Your Server's Cockpit</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Fortress.io enables you to monitor all the processes running on your server and will inform you whenever the version of software running on your server has a known vulnerability. Additionally, unncessary programs create unnessary vulnerabilities, so keeping an eye on all running programs will make your servers more secure. An added benefit of removing unncessary programs is ensuring that your servers are using their resources as efficiently as possible.</p>

            <h2>Minimize Risk</h2>
            <p>Hackers will often exploit software with known vulnerabilities to gain control of a server. Having fewer programs running gives hackers less opportunities to take advantage of out dated or insecure software.</p>

            <h2>Firewall Status</h2>
             <p>Quickly determine which of the services running on your server are visible to the public internet. Fortress.io makes it clear which services are locked down and which services are vulnerable.</p>

            <h2>Managed Startup</h2>
            <p>Servers need to be restarted once in a while.  When this happens, Fortress.io will ensure that your server is booted with the same services running as before the reboot. This is an often overlooked aspect of server administration, but Fortress.io makes it easy as Ramen.</p>
