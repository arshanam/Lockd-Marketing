            <h2>Managed Startup</h2>
            <p>Servers need to be restarted once in a while.  When this happens, Lockd will ensure that your server is booted with the same services running as before the reboot. This is an often overlooked aspect of server administration, but Lockd makes it easy as Ramen.</p>
